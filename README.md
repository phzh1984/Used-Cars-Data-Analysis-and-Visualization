# Used-Cars-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization

This repository contains analysis for the scraped data from 100,000 used car listings, segregated into files corresponding to various car manufacturers. The purpose of collecting this data was to develop a tool for predicting the optimal selling price for a friend's old car in comparison to similar listings in the market. 

Objective

The focus of this analysis centers around two commonly found cars in the British market: the Ford Focus and Mercedes C Class. The primary goal is to extract valuable insights such as identifying the ideal time to sell specific carsâ€”pinpointing ages and mileage thresholds where significant drops in resale value occur. Additionally, comparisons between the Ford Focus and Mercedes C Class will be made, and a classifier to distinguish between the two models will be developed. There's also flexibility to include more makes and models upon request.

The cleaned dataset encompasses crucial information including price, transmission, mileage, fuel type, road tax, miles per gallon (mpg), and engine size. Duplicate listings have been removed, and the columns have undergone cleaning. For transparency and collaboration, a notebook illustrating the data processing steps and the original dataset have been included.

This repository aims to provide insights and visualizations derived from the analyzed data.
